# Black Box v2

An experimental rework of [Black Box](https://github.com/hackclub/black-box/), with a robust, WASM-powered editor, better tooling, new firmware, and more!

As of now, this repository is a loosely organized collection of docs, code, and tests. If you want to learn more, come join us in [#black-box](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08APN1CKEJ) on the Hack Club Slack!
